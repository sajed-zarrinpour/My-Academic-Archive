# A Shape Constrained Parametric Active Contour Model For Breast Contour Detection

I am interested in cancer breast since my aunt had died from the disease. Though my main fucus is in some other part of the tale, but I was curious to know what will happen to survivors everyday life.
It was interesting to me that the mathematical modeling and numerical analysis is also handy there! wanna know how?
This presentation is a brief report of [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23366915) article to my supervisor. Hope you enjoy as I did making it.
