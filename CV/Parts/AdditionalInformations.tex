\begin{cSection}{Additional Information}
	\begin{enumerate}[*]
		\item \textbf{Official Records}. According to Islamic Republic of Iran's laws, I cannot afford my official records at the moment. Though, I may be able to provide them till February 2021. Anyhow, I can go through \href{https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/bewerbung/international/plausibilitaetspruefung.html}{\textcolor{blue}{Plausibility Check Procedure for Refugees Applying without Proof of Higher Education Entrance Eligibility (HZB)}} if needed.
		\item \textbf{Certificates}. I had seen your announcement a bit late (25th February) and I was short in time. Hence, as of now, I have no language certificate ready to present to you, but I can get them if necessary. Also, my transcript of records of bachelor and master degree is self translated and are unofficial. I believe I can provide more proper versions of them later.
