%Dear Prof. Xiaoyi Jiang, \vspace*{0.5em}
%	Dear Sir/Madam, \vspace*{0.5em}
Dear Selection Committee, \vspace*{0.5em}

Unfortunately, I have to inform you that due to compulsory national service regulations in Iran, I have some restrictions regarding presenting my official diplomas and records at the moment. I am fully aware that I shall provide them if I got selected, and I will. You can find an unofficial version of the transcript of the records below. Please contact my master's degree supervisor \href{https://iasbs.ac.ir/personalpage?id=31016&staff=0}{\textcolor{blue}{Dr. K. Nedaiasl (assistant professor at IASBS)}} if more authentication is needed.
%I am Sajed Zarinpour. I am writing in response to your Ph.D. position vacancy at the TU Wien University to express my interest in the position `RP3: Trustworthy Machine Learning'.

%I study machine learning for solving partial differential equations. I was working on cancer models (melanoma and breast cancer to be precise), studying mathematical models, and use machine learning methods as solvers to improve numerical methods. Hence I have a firm knowledge about neural networks and how they work under the hood as well as familiarity with mathematical modeling.
%I study the numerical solution of partial differential equations, based on deep neural networks, and am interested in using them to improve/enhance cancer treatments.
%	I have a keen desire to study biological models. Though my studies are not limited to cancer, most of my research is on breast cancer (the disease my aunt died from) and melanoma.

%	Back in 2018, I was thinking of a way to improve works like \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28982035/}{\textcolor{blue}{A finite element-based machine learning approach for modeling the mechanical behavior of the breast tissues under compression in real-time}} by going further to add uncertainties to incorporate patient-specific parameters in. This paper was the original turning point that shaped my masterâ€™s and my desire for Ph.D. To achieve my goal, I had to grasp a good knowledge of biophysical modeling which I tried my best with reading and understanding cancer models like \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519318305903}{\textcolor{blue}{Spatio-Genetic and phenotypic modelling elucidates resistance and re-sensitisation to treatment in heterogeneous melanoma}}, and participating in events like the winter school `From Biophysical Modeling to Simulation Codes, 2019' and `One World IMAGINE' Seminars.

%	Next, I needed a good foundation on computational aspects, especially I wanted to improve a method that was based on finite element method and with machine learning. Hence, I did a study in master on \textit{Solving Partial Differential Equations With Uncertainty Using Neural-Networks}.  Solving differential equations blindfolded is not my type. My goal is to express the beauty of the world around me in a universal language that can help other people. I have good skills in computer science and programming. Throughout the last three years, I tried to develop my mathematical skills as much as possible. 

%I want to take advantage of this opportunity to join your research group to pursue my research career in mathematical modeling and machine learning.  


%I've always tried to find my way toward understanding the underlying rules of the world. More Specifically, I have a keen desire to study biological models. Though my studies are not limited to cancer, most of my research is on breast cancer (the disease my aunt died from) and melanoma. Hence I am familiar with the biological concepts as well. Because of limitations I had I wasn't able to do any in vivo research, but I am eager to work with a team on real patients rather than numbers (To be honest, I was thinking of a way to improve \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28982035/}{\textcolor{blue}{A finite element-based machine learning approach for modeling the mechanical behavior of the breast tissues under compression in real-time}} by going further to add uncertainties ). My original major is on numerical analysis, solving differential equations blindfolded is not my type. My goal is to express the beauty of the world around me in a universal language that can help other people. Indeed, I decided to create a strong foundation for my knowledge that supports me for  It consists of study the world, modeling it, solving the model, and simulating. I decided to break down the whole process into smaller modules. Hence, I did study in master on \textit{Solving Partial Differential Equations With Uncertainty Using Neural-Networks}. It was quite a challenge for me to master the process and put things together.\\
%I had good skills in computer science and programming. Throughout the process, I tried to develop my mathematical skills as much as possible. I accomplished that in collaboration with my supervisor, advisor, and lab mates. Although my main quest is still has a long way to end, I acquired useful knowledge and skills in the journey.\\
%I want to take advantage of this opportunity to join your research group, where I believe I can develop my knowledge into use.% However, 
%Please note that %there is something I shall explain here. My master's degree finished on Oct 6, 2020, at the institute for advanced studies in basic sciences (IASBS), Zanjan, Iran. Though, 
%due to  compulsory national service regulations in Iran, I have some restrictions regarding presenting my official diplomas and records at the moment. I am fully aware that I shall provide them if I got selected, and I will. You can find an unofficial version of the transcript of the records below. Please contact my master's degree supervisor \href{https://iasbs.ac.ir/personalpage?id=31016&staff=0}{\textcolor{blue}{Dr. K.
