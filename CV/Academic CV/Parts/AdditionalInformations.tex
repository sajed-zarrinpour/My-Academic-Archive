		\item \textbf{Conserning Diplomas and Transcript of Records}.\\ Unfortunately, I have to inform you that due to compulsory national service regulations in Iran, I have some restrictions regarding presenting my official diplomas and records at the moment. I am fully aware that I shall provide them if I got selected, and I will. You can find an unofficial version of the transcript of the records in my documents. Please contact my master's degree supervisor \href{https://iasbs.ac.ir/personalpage?id=31016&staff=0}{\textcolor{blue}{Dr. K. Nedaiasl (assistant professor at IASBS)}} if more authentication is needed.
