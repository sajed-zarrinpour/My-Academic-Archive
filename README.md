# My-Academic-Archive
### A Single Repository to hold my thesis, presentations, hand outs, and more.

Please notice that this repository has *no license* specified with it, which means **if you want to use its content you have to read [this](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/#for-users) article**. 

I want to add a clause to that article. you *may* use the latex templates which I had used. Most of them are not my work, special thanks to comunity, and I dont want to claim any credit for my slight changes. You may read and use the contents if it fits your needs. Also, you may present them if you think there is good information which you want to share with people. You *may* fork your own repository, no problem,
**BUT YOU MAY NOT CHANGE THE CODE IN THE REPOSITORY!** and there is a good reason to that!

There well may be some errors in them and I appriciate if you open up an issue and mention them to me.

cheers!
sajed.
